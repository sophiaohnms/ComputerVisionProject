TO DO:
Data augmentation -----> Transform "Expand()" breaks the model? (Total Loss was around 800-1000)

Optimizers: ADAM or SGD(with and without nesterov)

Learning rate: scheduler 
Freeze layers on the pre-trained model for Waymo dataset?



SOLVED:
Feature maps: [2,2] or [3,3]* (Adjust the prior_box strides) ---> [3,3]
Out_channels: why [128, 256, 512, 128, 64, 64] and no others? ---> Better to keep increasing channels. 
Transform: Normalize() ---> SubstractMeans + /std
